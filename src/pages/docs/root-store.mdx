# Root store

`mobx-depot` generates a `RootStore` to manage instances of your data. Whenever a mutation or query is dispatched,
that data is deeply resolved by the `RootStore` in order to instantiate any models that are returned.

For example, given the following response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "__typename": "User",
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe"
    }
  }
}
```

`RootStore` will realize that `data.user` should be a `UserModel` and will instantiate it. If the `User` model
has any nested models, they will be instantiated as well.

## Existing instances are preserved

If a model instance already exists in the `RootStore`, it will be updated with the new data. This means that
if you have a `UserModel` instance in your `RootStore` and you dispatch a mutation or query that returns a `UserModel`
with the same ID, the existing record will be updated with the new data.

Of course, as a result of MobX's reactivity, any components or logic that is observing any affected records will
automatically update.

## Gotcha: New data can get duplicated

Consider the following scenario:

1. A local `UserModel` is created within a `RegisterForm` component
2. The user fills out the form and submits it
3. The `RegisterForm` component dispatches a mutation that creates a new `UserModel` on the server
4. The `RootStore` resolves a new `UserModel` from the response and instantiates it

There will be two `UserModel` instances: one that was created locally and one that was
created by the server, stored in the `RootStore`. This is because the local instance is not stored in the `RootStore`,
but more importantly, the IDs are not the same either.

But what if there's state within the local `UserModel` that you want to preserve? The `RootStore` provides a `replace`
method that allows you to replace an existing model instance with another one. Here's an example:

```ts
import { getRootStore } from './depot';

const rootStore = getRootStore();

class UserModel extends UserBaseModel {
  password = "";

  save() {
    const createUser = new CreateUserMutation({
      input: {
        email: this.email,
        password: this.password
      }
    });

    createUser.dispatch().then((response) => {
      // Problem: response.data.createUser is a new instance of the `UserModel` that the `RootStore` resolved.
      // It is not the same instance as `this`. The solution is to copy the data from the server's instance,
      // and replace the one in the `RootStore` with this.

      // 1. Copy the data from the persisted instance to the local instance.
      // The `assign` method is provided by the `UserBaseModel`, which is generated by `mobx-depot`.
      // It is available in all models. Note: This will also copy the ID of the server's instance.
      this.assign(response.data.createUser);

      // 2. Replace the RootStore's instance with this local one.
      // `this.store` is a reference to the `RootStore`, which is provided by the `UserBaseModel`.
      rootStore.replace(response.data.createUser, this);
    });
  }
}
```

Any observers that were observing the server's instance will now be observing the local instance.
