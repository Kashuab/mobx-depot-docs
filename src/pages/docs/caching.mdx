# Cache management

`mobx-depot` supports a handful of cache policies.

### `"cache-first"`
If the cache hit is successful, use the cached result and **do not** dispatch a network request.
Otherwise, send the request and cache the result.

### `"cache-only"`
If the cache hit is successful, use the cached result, otherwise **throw an error.**

### `"cache-and-network"`
Yield a cache hit immediately, but still send request and update cache in the background.

### `"network-only"`
Do not yield a cached result, but dispatch a request and update the cache.

### `"no-cache"`
Skip cache, dispatch a network request and **don't cache** the response.

## Configuring cache policies

To set the default cache policy for all queries, use the `defaultCachePolicy` option:

```ts
import { initializeDepotClient } from 'path/to/models/depot/rootStore';

initializeDepotClient('http://your-api.com', {
  defaultCachePolicy: 'cache-first',
});
```

If you need a specific cache policy for a given query, you can pass a `cachePolicy` option in the `Query` constructor:

```ts
import { PostQuery } from 'path/to/models/depot/queries/PostQuery';

const query = new PostQuery(
  post => post.title.content,
  { cachePolicy: 'cache-first' }
);

query.dispatch().then(result => {
  // ...
});
```

## How does the cache work?

The `RootStore` is responsible for holding all known instances of `Model` classes. Every GQL operation response goes
through the `RootStore#resolve` method, which deeply finds and updates/instantiates all applicable models within the
`response.data`.

The `DepotGQLClient`, which is responsible for handling GQL requests, has a minimal cache store that does not provide
any public methods at your disposal. This is on purpose -- since the cache store contains references to instances
maintained by the `RootStore`. This is ideal, considering if a mutation causes a known instance to update, it also
updates the cache of any applicable query automatically since the references are shared.

If you want to manually update an instance as a result of a mutation, you'd interact with the `RootStore` directly.

### Cache behavior walkthrough

Let's go through an example! I'll be omitting things like imports and other boilerplate code for brevity.

```ts
const userQuery = new UserQuery(
  user => user.firstName.lastName.email,
 { cachePolicy: 'cache-and-network' },
);

const user = await userQuery.dispatch();

console.log(user.id); // "1"
console.log(user.firstName); // "John"
console.log(user.lastName); // "Smith"
```

The `UserQuery` is dispatched, and the `cache-and-network` policy is used. The cache is checked (which yields nothing),
then the network request is dispatched. The response is received, and the `RootStore` is updated with the new `User`
instance. The instance is also cached in the `DepotGQLClient` cache store.

Now, let's update the user with an `UpdateUserMutation`:

```ts
const updateUserMutation = new UpdateUserMutation(
  { firstName: 'Joe', lastName: 'Mama' },
  user => user.firstName.lastName.email,
);

const updatedUser = await updateUserMutation.dispatch();

console.log(updatedUser.id); // "1"
console.log(updatedUser.firstName); // "Joe"
console.log(updatedUser.lastName); // "Mama"
```

The `UpdateUserMutation` is dispatched, and the `RootStore` is updated with the new `User` instance. The `User` instance
is also cached in the `DepotGQLClient` cache store. Since the response contains a `User` with the same `id`, the cache
for the `UserQuery` is updated with the new data. This is because the `RootStore` maintains a single instance for the
`User`, and the cache store contains a reference to that same instance.

Now, let's dispatch the `UserQuery` again, and use `autorun` from `mobx` so we can observe the `userQuery.data`:

```ts
autorun(() => {
  console.log(userQuery.data.user.firstName);
  // "Joe" (cached), then "Joe" again (network)
});

await userQuery.dispatch();
```

We'd get two `"Joe"` logs. Why is this? Let's break it down:

1. The `UserQuery` is dispatched, and the `cache-and-network` policy is used.
2. The cache is checked, and since it's not empty, the cached `User` instance is returned immediately.
3. The network request is dispatched, and the new response is received with the updated data.
