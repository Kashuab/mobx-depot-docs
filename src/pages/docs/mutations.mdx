# Mutations

The `Mutation` type in your GraphQL schema contains each mutation that you can dispatch. `mobx-depot` converts each
mutation into its own class.

For example, given the following schema:

```graphql
input CreateUserInput {
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  email: String!
  password: String!
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(input: CreateUserInput!): User
}
```

This will generate a `CreateUserMutation` class that you can use as such:

```js
import { CreateUserMutation } from "~/models/depot/mutations/CreateUserMutation";

const createUser = new CreateUserMutation(
  // Mutation arguments
  {
    input: {
      firstName: "John",
      lastName: "Doe",
      email: "johndoe@example.com",
      password: "abracadabra"
    }
  },
  // Select the fields you want to retrieve
  user => user.name.email
);

createUser.mutate().then(user => {
  // user is a UserModel, which is a MobX observable
  // It can also be null, as described by the schema
});
```
