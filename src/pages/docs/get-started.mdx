# Get started

Assuming you already have `react` installed...

- `yarn add mobx-depot mobx graphql`

Next, enable experimental decorators in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  ... // other config
  "compilerOptions": {
    ... // other options
    "experimentalDecorators": true
  }
}
```

## Generate code

- `yarn mobx-depot generate http://localhost:3000/graphql --outDir src/models`
- (You can also provide a path to a `schema.graphql` or `introspection.json` file)

This will generate a `src/models` directory with the following structure:

- `depot` (Don't touch anything in here. `generate` will overwrite this whole directory!)
  - `base`
    - `XBaseModel.ts`
    - `YBaseModel.ts`
    - `ZBaseModel.ts`
  - `inputs`
    - `SomeOperationInput.ts`
  - `mutations`
    - `SomeOperationMutation.ts`
  - `queries`
    - `SomeOperationQuery.ts`
  - `hooks.ts`
  - `rootStore.tsx`
  - `scalars.ts`
- `XModel.ts` (You can edit these!)
- `YModel.ts`
- `ZModel.ts`

### CLI options

- `--include User,Post,Comment` Whitelist object types to be generated into models (Comma-separated values)
- `--exclude UserMetadata,PostAnalytics` Blacklist object types from being generated into models (Comma-separated values)

Only use one or the other, it doesn't make much sense to use both `--include` and `--exclude`.

- `--react true|false` Include React utilities in generated output (defaults to true)
- `--idFieldName` Name of the field used to identify object types (defaults to "id")
- `--depotDirName <name of directory>` Directory that untouchable auto-generated code should be placed in (defaults to "depot")

You can reference these anytime in the CLI: `yarn mobx-depot --help generate`

## Setup your app root

Your app will have some sort of `src/App.tsx`. You will need to initialize the client `mobx-depot` will use to
make requests to your GraphQL API.

```tsx
import { initializeDepotClient } from './models/depot';

// This may be different if you're not using Vite, or have some other environment variable for this.
const API_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;

initializeDepotClient(API_URL, {
  // You can pass in any options that `graphql-request` supports, however there's an extra "defaultCachePolicy" option.
  // "cache-and-network" is the default, but you can change it if you want.
  defaultCachePolicy: 'cache-and-network',
});

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

`initializeDepotClient` will initialize a `DepotGQLClient`, which is basically a wrapper around `graphql-request`'s
`GraphQLClient` that adds support for caching of responses.

Now you're ready to get cooking!
