# Models

Each object type in your GraphQL schema is converted into two things: a `BaseModel` class, and a `Model` subclass.
The `BaseModel` class contains the fields from your schema, as well as some helper methods (we'll get into that later.)

For example, given the following schema:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  email: String!
}
```

This will generate the following `BaseModel`:

```ts
// Do not edit any BaseModel! They are generated automatically and will be overwritten.
export class UserBaseModel {
  @Selectable() id!: ID;
  @Selectable() firstName!: string;
  @Selectable() lastName!: string;
  @Selectable() email!: string;

  // ... constructor, helper methods, etc...
}
```

And the following `Model`:

```ts
// Feel free to add any fields or methods! Try not to touch the constructor, however.
export class UserModel extends UserBaseModel {
  constructor(init: Partial<UserModel> = {}) {
    super(init);

    makeModelObservable(this);
  }
}
```

You can instantiate a `UserModel` like so:

```ts
const user = new UserModel({
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  email: "johndoe@example.com"
});
```

## Adding logic to a model

You can add any fields or methods to your `Model` class. For example, you can add a `fullName` computed property:

```ts
export class UserModel extends UserBaseModel {
  constructor(init: Partial<UserModel> = {}) {
    super(init);

    makeModelObservable(this);
  }

  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
}
```

This is super valuable because any data returned from mutations and queries will get deeply converted into
their respective `Model` instances. This means you can conveniently access any fields or methods you've added to your
`Model` class.

### What is `@Selectable`?

The `@Selectable` decorator adds logic that throws an error if you try to access a field that was not selected from a
query. This helps you avoid optional chaining and other null checks all over your code.

For example, given the following query:

```graphql
query {
  user {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

If you try to access `user.email`, you'll get an error:

```ts
// Imagine `user` is a `UserModel` instance that was returned from a query
user.email; // Error: Field "email" is not selected
```

This is ideal, as it keeps your code clean and prevents your logic from silently producing invalid results.

### What is `makeModelObservable`?

You may have noticed that generated models use `makeModelObservable` from `mobx-depot` instead of `makeAutoObservable`.
MobX has limitations regarding the use of `makeAutoObservable` with subclasses. `makeModelObservable` works around this
limitation by determining the required annotations by traversing over `this` and its prototypes, then providing them to
`makeObservable`.

**Do not use this in your own code.** This works for us because:

- We're not extending an external class
- `BaseModel`s are designed to be inherited from, and are not meant to be instantiated directly

[See relevant MobX discussion for more details.](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/discussions/2850#discussioncomment-5022315)

### `wontfix`

I'd like to emphasize [@urugator's comment](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/discussions/2850#discussioncomment-498925):

Any usage of `makeModelObservable` outside of the sole purpose of extending `BaseModel`s is unsupported. Any issues
regarding non-generated usage of `makeModelObservable` will be closed as `wontfix`.

I have yet to find a case where this doesn't work. If you do, _please open an issue!_
